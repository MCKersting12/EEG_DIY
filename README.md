# EEG_DIY
## Building EEG from Arduino and playing with the data


## Long term goals: 

### 1- control motor with EEG

### 2- Use Tensorflow to classify EEG data
	
	a) can a model tell whether or not I have had my coffee?
	
	b) can a model predict my emotion?


## Steps

### 1- Read analog voltage (potentiometer) from arduino into python
